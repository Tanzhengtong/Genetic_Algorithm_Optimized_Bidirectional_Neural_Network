# Genetic_Algorithm_Optimized_Bidirectional_Neural_Network
This paper has proposed a new methodology that hybridizes Bidirectional Neural Network (BDNN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to develop a more robust classifier. We use a genetic algorithm-based feature selection method to optimize the initial network parameters and then fine-tune these parameters via Error back-propagation. This methodol- ogy takes advantage of global search ability from GA and local search capability from BP to obtain an optimal result. Our result shows that GA-optimized BDNN could achieve promising classification performance on two different data sets with an accuracy of 92.50% and 100% respectively. We find this model has better generalization ability and faster convergence compared with a traditional BDNN. We believe our work provides a unique bio-inspired perspective and direction for deep learning research. Therefore, it may worth investigating the performance of this methodology on other bidirectional neural architectures.
